I require a pixel-perfect, award-winning "Menu Page" implementation inspired by 'drinkzoi.co', with liquid page transitions and floating atmospheric elements.

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies
Ensure these are installed: `npm install react-router-dom framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge`

### 2. Architecture: The "Liquid Router"
Refactor `src/App.tsx` to handle page routing with a "Liquid Curtain" wipe effect.
- **Router:** Use `BrowserRouter`.
- **Animation Controller:** Wrap Routes in `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"`.
- **The Effect:** When moving between Home and Menu, a black/indigo wave must slide up from the bottom, cover the screen 100%, and then slide up to reveal the new page.

### 3. Component: `src/components/LiquidTransition.tsx`
Create a reusable wrapper component.
- **Logic:** It should wrap the page content.
- **Entrance:** Content fades in *after* the curtain lifts.
- **Exit:** Content stays visible until the curtain covers it.
- **The Curtain:** Use a `motion.div` with `z-index: 50`. It should have a "curved" top edge (using `border-top-left-radius` or `clip-path`) during the animation to simulate liquid fluid.

### 4. The Masterpiece: `src/pages/Menu.tsx`
This page must be an immersive experience, not just a list.

**A. The Atmosphere (Floating Particles)**
- Create a background layer with deep dark colors (`bg-[#050505]`).
- **Bubbles:** Create 5-10 div elements with radial gradients (transparent centers, white/blue outlines) that float upward infinitely using different durations (10s, 15s, 20s).
- **Leaves/Ice:** Use `lucide-react` icons (`Leaf`, `Snowflake`) that float, rotate, and drift randomly across the screen using `animate={{ x: ..., y: ..., rotate: ... }}`.

**B. The Typography**
- **Header:** "FLAVORS" in massive text (`text-[10rem]`) using 'Titan One' font.
- **Interaction:** The text should mask a video or have a gradient that shifts on mouse move.

**C. The Product Cards (Zoi Interaction)**
- **Grid:** 3 columns.
- **Card State:**
  - **Idle:** Image is grayscale or desaturated, Title is small.
  - **Hover:**
    1. The Image scales up 1.2x and rotates 5deg.
    2. The Grayscale filter is removed (full color).
    3. A colored "blob" (matching the drink flavor) fades in behind the bottle/cup.
    4. The Price and "Add to Cart" button slide up from opacity 0.

### 5. Implementation Details
- **File Structure:**
  - `src/App.tsx` (Router setup)
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx` (Your existing Spline/Hero code)
  - `src/pages/Menu.tsx` (The new Zoi code)
  - `src/components/LiquidTransition.tsx` (The transition logic)

**Data Source for Menu:**
```typescript
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: "Artisan Pizza", price: "$12", src: "/Animation/1.png", color: "bg-orange-500" },
  { id: 2, name: "Hot Coffee", price: "$5", src: "/Animation/2.png", color: "bg-amber-600" },
  { id: 3, name: "Mojito", price: "$8", src: "/Animation/3.png", color: "bg-emerald-500" },
  { id: 4, name: "Sandwich", price: "$7", src: "/Animation/4.png", color: "bg-red-500" },
  { id: 5, name: "Cold Coffee", price: "$6", src: "/Animation/5.png", color: "bg-indigo-500" }
];
