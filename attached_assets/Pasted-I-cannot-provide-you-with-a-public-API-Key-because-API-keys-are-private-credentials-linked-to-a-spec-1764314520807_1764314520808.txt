I cannot provide you with a public API Key because API keys are private credentials linked to a specific billing account. If I shared mine, it would be disabled immediately for security reasons.

However, Gemini API keys are FREE for most use cases. You can get one in 30 seconds here: Get a Free Gemini API Key

Once you have your key, here is the Master Prompt to give Replit AI. It instructs the AI to build "Maggie" — a fully functional, floating AI Chatbot that lives on your frontend and talks to your customers.

📋 COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI
Plaintext

I need to add an AI Chatbot named "Maggie" to my website using the Gemini API.

### 1. New Dependency
Please install the Google AI SDK:
`npm install @google/generative-ai react-markdown`

### 2. The Persona
"Maggie" is the digital barista of 'Love Over Coffee'.
- **Personality:** Friendly, witty, obsessed with coffee, and helpful.
- **Role:** She answers questions about the menu, recommends drinks, and jokes about caffeine.
- **System Instruction:** "You are Maggie, the AI Barista for Love Over Coffee. You answer briefly. You love using coffee puns. If asked about the menu, recommend the 'Artisan Pizza' or 'Cold Coffee'."

### 3. Component: `src/components/MaggieChat.tsx`
Create a floating chat widget.

**UI Requirements:**
- **Floating Button:** A round button in the bottom-right corner (z-index 100) with a "Sparkles" or "Bot" icon.
- **Chat Window:** When clicked, it opens a sleek glass-morphic chat window.
- **Messages:**
  - User messages: Aligned right, Indigo background.
  - Maggie messages: Aligned left, Dark gray background, typing effect (or simple loading spinner).
- **Input:** Text field + Send button.

**Logic Requirements:**
- Use `GoogleGenerativeAI` from `@google/generative-ai`.
- **API Key:** Use a constant variable `const API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE";` (I will fill this in later).
- **History:** Keep a local state of the conversation array so the context is preserved.

### 4. Implementation Details
Please generate the full code for `src/components/MaggieChat.tsx`.
Make sure to handle:
1. **Loading State:** Show "Maggie is brewing a response..." while waiting.
2. **Error Handling:** If the API fails, say "Oof! I spilled the beans. Try again."
3. **Auto-Scroll:** The chat view should scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives.

**Code Structure Example:**
```tsx
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
// ... imports

export default function MaggieChat() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([{ role: "model", text: "Hey! I'm Maggie. Need a caffeine fix recommendation?" }]);
  
  // ... handleSend logic using genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" })
  
  return (
     // ... JSX for Button and Chat Window
  )
}
5. Integration
Tell me exactly where to add <MaggieChat /> in my src/App.tsx so it appears globally on every page.

### 🚀 How to make it work (After the AI generates the code):

1.  **Get your Key:** Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Create Key:** Click "Create API Key".
3.  **Paste It:** Open the `src/components/MaggieChat.tsx` file that Replit creates. Look for the line that says `PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE` and paste your key inside the quotes.
    * *Example:* `const API_KEY = "AIzaSyD.......";`

Now "Maggie" will work on your laptop, your phone, and your friend's phone all at th
